# About

mappy is an internal tool for viewing the maps of Purdue's buildings. It was used for ITaP employees to find locations of rooms and PICs while out in the field. mappy is a very small application that can be easily deployed to any campus.

### Why build this?

Many times during the job, students would be asked to go to a new building or find some device without knowing where they need to be. They might take a picture before heading out or attempt to locate it by description alone, but these solutions have their drawbacks. Enter mappy. With mappy, you have the entire building at your fingertips and, with it, the speed to find what you need.

### Features

- Supports both mobile and desktop
- Includes a PDF renderer optimized for mobile
- Allows users to download maps for offline use
- Users can search for buildings for ease-of-use
- Adding or removing buildings is as simple as adding the PDFs
