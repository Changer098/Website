# About

pymv is a python library for automating [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) jobs. It provides many wrapper functions around the ffmpeg and ffprobe command-line tool such as setting audio and video encoders, creating new metadata, and determing the duration of a media file. 

## Goals

The desire for pymv is provide wrapper abilities for the average uses of ffmpeg while allowing for easy expandability. This includes having the ability to encode video, apply filters add or change metadata, etc. All of these features should be easily accessible for writing [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) scripts or entire tools for automating things with [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/). 

## Current Status

This project is in the very very early stages of development so things are constantly being changed or refactored.
